    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>160ml whole milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>550g sweetcorn</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, chopped, plus a little extra cut into thin strips to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>10g sliced chives</li>
        <li>handful of parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>rapeseed oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Mix the flour, baking powder, paprika and milk together in a large bowl. Mix in the egg, followed by the
            sweetcorn, chopped spring onions, chives, parsley, 1 tsp salt and some freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a 1cm depth of oil in a frying pan over a medium heat until a small amount of the fritter mixture
            sizzles when dropped in. For larger fritters, drop 2 heaped tablespoons of the mixture into the pan at a
            time in a clockwise direction (this will help you remember the order they were added to the pan, so you can
            flip them at the right stage). For smaller fritters, do the same, but with 1 heaped tablespoon of mixture at
            a time.</li>
        <li>After 2 mins, flip the fritters over in the same order they were added to the pan. Cook for another 2 mins,
            continuing to turn every now and then to ensure both sides are evenly golden brown. When ready, the fritters
            should be darker brown with crispy pieces of corn at the edges â€“ be careful, as some of the kernels may
            burst during the cooking process. Remove to a wire rack and pat away any excess oil using kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>Serve straightaway with a few strips of spring onion scattered over, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
