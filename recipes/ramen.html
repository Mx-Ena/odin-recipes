        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2
            minutes or until soft and fragrant. </li>
        <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the
            mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
        <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have
            softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a
            soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to
            taste.</li>
        <li>To make crunchy golden panko crumbs, heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the panko, stir for one minute or less, or until golden brown. Remove and place on paper towels to
            drain. You can also toss the panko with a little oil and toast them in the oven to get them golden and
            crispy.</li>
